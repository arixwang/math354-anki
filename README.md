# math354-anki
Anki cards for MATH 354

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Anki installed on your local machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository: ``git clone https://github.com/[username]/math354-anki.git``
Replace `[username]` with the username of the repository owner.

### Directly Downloading the Anki File

If you prefer to directly download the Anki file instead of cloning the entire repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.
2. Find the Anki file (with the `.apkg` extension) in the list of files.
3. Click on the file name.
4. You will be taken to a new page. Click on the `Download` icon button to download the file.
5. Once downloaded, you can import it into Anki by opening the Anki application and clicking on `File > Import...` and selecting the downloaded `.apkg` file.

### Accessing the Anki File

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
2. You will find the Anki file(s) with the extension `.apkg`.
3. Open the Anki application.
4. In Anki, click on `File > Import...` and select the `.apkg` file from the repository.

Now, you should be able to use the Anki cards for MATH 354.
